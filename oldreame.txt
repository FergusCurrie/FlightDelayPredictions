Also master local isntead of yarn?

We want to use hadoop for the final version, which means we'll need to make 2 changes:
In the java files, we need to change:
SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()
				.appName(appName)
				.master("local")
				.getOrCreate();
Maybe just get rid of the .master("local")? Not sure if we need to change it to something else or just get rid of it.
We also need to change the %spark-submit command so that it's:
--master yarn 
--deploy-mode cluster

Someone will need to run it and check that everything works on cluster.

I think we should also specify that the kdd.data file needs to be put in the input folder

# Setup: 
Connect to the cluster: 
%ssh <user>@barretts.ecs.vuw.ac.nz
%ssh co246a-1

Navigate to submission directory + setup environment
%source SetupSparkClasspath.csh

Make hadoop input and output folders
%hdfs dfs mkdir /user/<user>/input
%hdfs dfs mkdir /user/<user>/output

Put kdd.data into hadoop
%hdfs dfs -put kdd.data /user/<user>/input




# LogisticRegression : 

%javac -cp "lib/*" -d test_classes src/LogReg.java
%jar cvf LogReg.jar -C test_classes/ .
%spark-submit --class "LogReg.LogReg" --master local LogReg.jar /user/<user>/input /user/<user>/output


# DecisionTree : 

Running:
%javac -cp "lib/*" -d test_classes src/DecTree.java
%jar cvf DecTree.jar -C test_classes/ .
%spark-submit --class "DecTree.DecTree" --master local DecTree.jar /user/<user>/input /user/<user>/output
